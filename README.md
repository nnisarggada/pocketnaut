> 🧑‍🚀 **A minimal Astro, PocketBase, and TailwindCSS starter that uses TypeScript and has sane defaults**

## 📖 Documentation

- [Astro](https://docs.astro.build)
- [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/docs)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

## ‼️ Important: Ensure `pocketbase` is installed and added to `$PATH`

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── backend/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── layouts/
│       └── Base.astro
│   └── components/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
│   └── styles/
│       └── global.css
│   └── utils/
│       └── pocketbase.ts
│   └── icons/
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
